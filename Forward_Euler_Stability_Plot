%to plot the area of absolute stability for a stiff problem, We assume the
%ODE is of the form y'(t)=ky(t) for some real-valued k.
%After using algebra we see Forward Euler's method can be simplified to
%y_n+1=y0(1+hk)^n, it's easy to see this blows up for |1+hk|>1, and
%additionally stays stagnant if |1+hk|=1, thus not converging. This yields
%the area of absolute stability (formally defined as the area of hk where
%the method always converges for arbitrarily larhe h) to be the area where
%|1+hk|<1, plotted on the complex plane:


theta=linspace(0,2*pi,1000)
x=cos(theta)-1
y=sin(theta)
figure;
plot(x,y,'k')%recall that the boundery is not included in the domain, so I
% will plot the curve seperately to display that
hold on; %don't restart my graph
